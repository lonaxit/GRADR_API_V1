Project Description 

The project name is called gradr, its a school management application that seeks to automate results and scores compilation


------ACTIONS-----
1. Itemize the list of models that the software application needs 
2. Try to establish their relationship
3. Identifies properties on the model and state how they can help achieve our goals
